Summertime is my favorite time of year. During the weekend we head up to my favorite place, Cold Stream Pond. This is
the best place to spend your summer. Here, I go for boot rides, long walks on the dirt roads,
and jump off the dock to retrieve a stick. I am a great jumper (check out my video below). My family tells me they
have never seen a dog jump off the dock as well as I do!
