<p>I love the snow! I am a labrador retriever so I can handle the cold weather and the snow. When it is snowing
outside I jump in the air and try to catch the snowflakes (check out the video below). My Dad loves
to take me cross country skiing during the winter. Check out the video below to watch me
chase him down the hill!</p>
