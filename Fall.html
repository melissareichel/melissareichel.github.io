<p>During the fall I love to go hiking with my family. The foliage is beautiful this time of year and my Mom and sisters
love to take pictures of all the gorgeous trees. One of my favorite hikes was climbing to the top of Mount 
Battie in Camden, Maine. Look how pretty the leaves are in the picture below!</p>
